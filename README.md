# WebPageWordCounter

Welcome, so this page counter is simply a lightweight easy to use and copy Page counter, it basically scrapes the web (URL you give it) and takes a value which is the word you give it as well and counts how many words are in that webpage

NOTE:
if the Flask app doesn't work, you must create a "Template" directory to store the index.html file in, as well as a "Static" directory to store the style.css folder in as well.
